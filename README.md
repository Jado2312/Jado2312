## Hello there  

Iâ€™m a student of computer engineering at the TEC. 

I have liked computing since I was in school, when I met my first computer.

As hobbies I usually play video games and read fantasy/science fiction/cosmic horror novels.

Iâ€™m currently learning about OS and computational molecular biology to integrate my love for science with my work.
